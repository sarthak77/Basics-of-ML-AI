## SMAI Assignment-1

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to enhance the understanding of the basic mathematical tools required for the machine learning.

### Dataset
We use a subset of the extremely popular simple data set MNIST for this Assignment. This data set has many images of handwritten digits 0 to 9. i.e., 10 classes. Each image is of size 28 Ã— 28. In our subset there are 7000 images in total from 10 classes out of which 6000 are for training and 1000 are for testing.

### Subtasks

#### Task-1
 - Plot eigen value spectrum of various digits

#### Task-2
 - Reduce dimensions using PCA

#### Task-3
 - Perform classification using MAP, MLE, Majority voting and perpendicular bisector methods

#### Task-4
 - Perform KNN classification and use it for identifying outliers
